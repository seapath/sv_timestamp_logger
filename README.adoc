== Description
The SV Timestamp Logger tool lets you record the timestamps of sample values received on a network interface.

In accordance with the IEC 61850 standard, SV enable the transmission of current and voltage values in the form of different digital streams. With this tool, it is possible to listen to one or all streams.

If the NIC enables hardware PTP, hardware timestamping can also be activated.

If required, the SV drop can be calculated, i.e. the number of SVs that could not be logged.

Note that the timestamp record file is configurable and that it is also possible to record only the timestamp of the first SV.

== How to install

=== Get SV parser

sv_timestamp_logger uses [sv_parser](https://github.com/seapath/sv_parser) as a git submodule. The sv_timestamp_logger repository must be cloned with `--recurse-submodules` option.
If you already clone the repository without this submodule, you can launch `git submodule update --init`.

=== Build Docker container
Just run:
```bash
docker build . --tag sv_timestamp_logger
```
If you want to create an archive:
```bash
docker image save -o sv_timestamp_logger.tar sv_timestamp_logger
```

=== Cross compilation

This container was tested on both x86 and arm64 machines. Cross-compilation is available throug Docker build command.

For example, to build the container for arm64 on a x86 machine, use the command
```bash
docker build --platform linux/arm64 . --tag sv_timestamp_logger_arm64
```

== Usage

Launch the docker container with the following command, to get the help message of sv_timestamp_logger.
```bash
docker run sv_timestamp_logger --help
```

For example, the following command launch sv_timestamp_logger to capture all SV streams on interface enp3s0 and log them to /tmp/sv_log.
```bash
docker run --cap-add=sys_nice -v /tmp:/tmp --network=host sv_timestamp_logger -d enp3s0 -f /tmp/sv_log
```

Note: `--cap-add=sys_nice` and `--network=host` option are required respectively to enable RT priority and to access the host network interfaces.

=== Usage on SEAPATH

For more information on how to use this tool to test a SEAPATH infrastructure, refer to ["Simulating IEC61850 traffic for Seapath"](https://lf-energy.atlassian.net/wiki/x/RY3lAQ) on the SEAPATH wiki.
